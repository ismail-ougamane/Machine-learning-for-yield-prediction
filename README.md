# Machine-learning-for-yield-prediction
The project can be Summaries into 2 main parts, the first part is for us to show the use of machine learning algorithms for yield prediction, in this part, we have formulate the problematic of the project into 3 research questions, then we have present the use of 2 main keywords in this project yield prediction and machine learning, after that we have present the use of machine learning in yield prediction and in the end of this part, I have answers to the 3 research questions.The second part of this project is a case study for yield prediction in Ghana using machine learning algorithms, the process of the conduct of the project consist of four steps the first step is gathering data, the second step is pre-processing the data, the third step is exploring the data and the last is building and choosing the best machine learning model for yield prediction.
